## Introduction
This document provides information about the documentation of the XENSIVâ„¢ Predictive Maintenance Evaluation Kit EVAL_XMC47_PREDMAIN_AA.  
For a generic description of the features and benefits, please compare the [README.md](/README.md) file from the repository root.

## Organization of the Documentation
Overall, the documentation is divided into the following sections:

* README.md
* Quick Start Guide
* Software Documentation
* AWS Infrastructure Documentation
* Hardware Documentation

## Quick Start Guide
**Link to the [Quick Start Guide](./00_QuickStart.md)**

The quick start document provides a step-by-step guide on how to quickly setup an instance of the kit.  
It provides information on how to deploy the AWS infrastructure with an automatized process.  
Moreover, based on a precompiled `.hex` file, it allows the user to flash the XMC700 microcontroller of the EVAL_XMC47_PREDMAIN_AA kit.

All users who want to have a first, quick setup should start from this document.
If a user wants to get full development access, the following sections provide additional information. 

## Hardware Documentation
